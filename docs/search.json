I am currently a Master of Health Science student at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health studying Genetic Epidemiology.\r\nI am passionate about leveraging data science tools to answer complex public health questions. I am particularly interested in understanding the roles of genetic and environmental factors in the etiology of chronic diseases. During my schooling, I have actively participated in and supported diverse and interdisciplinary research projects, spanning the topics of molecular biology, genetics, epigenetics, social science, and clinical research.\r\nI am also an advocate for health equity and dedicated to improving the health of underserved communities through my research and volunteerism.\r\nContact Me:  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
