***Hi, I'm Meredith!***
I am currently a Master of Health Science student at Johns Hopkins University's Bloomberg School of Public Health studying Genetic Epidemiology. 

I am passionate about leveraging data science tools to answer complex public health questions. I am particularly interested in understanding the roles of genetic and environmental factors in the etiology of chronic diseases. During my schooling, I have actively participated in and supported diverse and interdisciplinary research projects, spanning the topics of epidemiology, molecular biology, genetics, epigenetics, social science, and clinical research.  

I am also an advocate for health equity and dedicated to improving the health of underserved communities through my research and volunteerism.
